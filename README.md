# Infinite Panning Example

A three.js script created for demonstration purposes on how infinite panning can be achieved using two copies a 2D map.

Pressing 'c' changes the camera zoom to better understand when the camera moves to one of the objects.
Pressing 'r' changes the color of the right object to better understand which copy the camera is looking at.
